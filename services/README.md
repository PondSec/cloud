# Services

This repo is a multi-service system.

Current top-level services live in:
- `/backend` (Flask)
- `/frontend` (React)
- `/ide-backend` (Node)
- `/runner` (Node)

New services introduced during the platform build should be placed under `/services/<name>` unless there is a strong reason not to (documented via ADR).
